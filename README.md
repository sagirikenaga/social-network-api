# Module 12 Challenge: Social Network API

## Description

This project was built in order to create an API used for a social network using MongoDB. It allows for new users to be added, where users may post their thoughts. Additionally, users may add "reactions" to other users' thoughts. Using Insomnia, the user is able to view all the users, thoughts and reactions stored in the database. The user may also add a new user, update a user or delete it. A thought or reaction may also be added and deleted. This project allowed me to apply my knowledge learned about MongoDB and Mongoose to create a backend database for an API. 

## Installation

Clone/fork this repository at https://github.com/sagirikenaga/employee-tracker. Then, run the command: npm i, npm run seed, then npm start. A message will appear to indicate whether the application is successfully running, then the user may use Insomnia to access the various routes. 

## Usage

This project is used by following the installation process described above, then accessing the data through Insomnia. With Insomnia, using the localhost and PORT described in the server.js file, the different routes can be accessed. For example, in order to access the page containing all the category data, the link http://localhost:3001/api/thoughts/ can be inputted into the html bar and "GET" can be selected. The results will display on the right. In order to add either a user, reaction or thought, the user may input the information using a POST route. The PUT and DELETE routes may also be used in order to update and delete components, respectively. For more information, please view the video linked below.
